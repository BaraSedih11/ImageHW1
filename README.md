Image Processing HW1 using cv2 library




Reading the input image:

Converting the image into gray-scale:

Modifying the brightness of the image using gamma correction with a random gamma value. Use the following two methods:

-a-Using look-up table

-By modifying each pixel individually (without look-up table):

 Comparing between the execution time of both methods:

The image using LUT gamma correction is very better than manually

Showing the histogram after processing (both methods should have the same histogram)
